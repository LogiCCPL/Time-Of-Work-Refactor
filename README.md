# Time Of Work

The application is used to track your time at work. The idea for creating this app came from the fact that I wanted to be in charge of my working hours.

## Why Refactor ?

This is a copy of my first project, but much more cleanly written.

## User manual

When a user starts his work, it is enough to press the "Start" button. If the breaks are not a part of the working time, you must set the time for the break on the particular day. Then, when work for a given day is finished, just press the "Stop" button. In case a user forgets to turn on the application on one day, you can always add a working day manually by pressing "Plus" in the bottom menu bar. In a "History" tab, a user can see his working hours in particular weeks.

## Features

* control your working hours
* add work days
* store your work history
* compare individual weeks

## Technology I used

* SwiftUI
